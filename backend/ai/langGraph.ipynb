      " The image displays a collection of mechanical components and fasteners, arranged in two columns against a plain background. Each column is labeled with the number of units provided next to each component's representation. Starting from the left, there are three cylindrical bolts, each indicated by \"10 ×\". Followed by four flat washers with \"5 ×\" written next to them. The second column shows two nuts (also labeled as \"20 ×\") and a single hex bolt with \"6 ×\" notation. Above these components is an image of what appears to be a mechanical assembly or part, which could possibly be the item that these fasteners are used for. The image is in black and white, and it has a schematic or technical drawing style. There are no texts other than the quantity indications.\n"
