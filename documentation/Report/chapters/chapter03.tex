\begin{itemize}
    \item Main Focus
    \item Model selection (Performance Metrix, )
    \item Why not a standard LLM? (Show example results here?)
    \item Explain models.py and why we are not going to use it.
    \item 2 agentic architectures with better models (api).
    \item Examples of outputs from the used architectures (vision, text) or the worse 2 agentic models.
    \item Computational costs (Agentic Structure vs. naive prompting vs. local). 
    \item explain the structures we had (CLIP to Reasoning, Vision to Reasoning and Christans). (White Board)
